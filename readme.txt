Unified is a plugin that combines functionalities that most sites use, all in one plugin, with a sharp focus on high performance and low memory usage.

== Description ==

Unified aims to provide standard functionality that almost all sites use or should use, such as page caching, clean responses, custom SMTP and good security.

**Our current features:**

- **Email log**
    - Searchable list of email sent from the site, where emails content can be viewed, re-send and more.
- **Email Queue**
    - Never make the user wait for emails being sent by the system again, where it might fail
    - Queue emails and send the emails in the background instead, with support for retrying when mails cant be sent.
- **Page caching**
    - Very fast page caching - Just enable and we take care of the rest
    - WooCommerce support
- **SMTP setup**
    - Configure a custom SMTP server to send your emails through
- **Clean-up**
    - Clean up the response generated by WordPress
- **Security**
    - Configure security headers to make your site more safe
    - Enable header X-Frame-Options
    - Enable header X-Content-Type-Options
    - Enable header Referrer-Policy
    - Enable header Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

Our goal is to make the functionality simple, with high performance and low memory footprint, over the cost, which is that it can not support all the same features as the specialized plugins.

But the argument here is that simplicity, high performance, low memory usage and easy setup is more important than frontend users gets served 10ms faster with the bloated specialized plugins.

Having specialized plugins for common functional needs could seem like a good idea, but they are often over-engineered and bloated.
Each plugin often has its own libraries loaded, configurations, files and more to make it work.

So you have to configure them in different places and they may not even work well together.

Also, having many plugins, tend to make to the admin section (/wp-admin) very slow, as it often loads the entire world in all plugins, each of them checking their licenses etc.

**What if Unified doesnt support feature X that I need?**

Unified does not intend to be the plugin with all functionality, but only the have the basics with high performance.
But we would appreciate your input, if you feel like something is missing. Please contact <support@daev.tech> for the details.

As example, if you need another SMTP plugin with a certain feature set, you can just install that and disable it in Unified.
When you disable features in Unified, you **really** disable it, so that it no longer loads anything.

== Plan for Unified ==

We have great plans for Unified and many features planned already.

Our ultimate vision for Unified, is that our users use Unified as a base plugin on their sites, to cover most of the standard functionality that most sites use.
